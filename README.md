# IASC Certificate Splitter

## Overview
[International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC)](https://iasc.cosmosearch.org/) is a citizen science initiative that allows participants worldwide to engage in Asteroid Search campaigns in partnership with NASA and PAN-STARRS Telescopes.

At the end of each campaign, IASC provides participation certificates to team leaders, who are then responsible for distributing them to their teammates. To simplify this process, I have created the **IASC Certificate Splitter** â€” a web application that automates splitting the PDF certificates and saving them individually with filenames matching the names on the certificates.

## Features
- Automatically splits IASC-issued PDF certificates into separate files.
- Saves each certificate with the participant's name as the filename.
- Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit.
- Eliminates the manual effort required to distribute certificates.

## Try It Out
Access the web application here: [IASC Certificate Splitter](https://iasc-certificate-splitter.streamlit.app/)

## How It Works
1. Upload the PDF file containing multiple certificates.
2. The application processes the document and extracts each certificate.
3. Each certificate is saved as an individual file, named after the recipient.
4. Download the split certificates for easy distribution.
